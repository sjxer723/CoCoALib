<h2>Quick Summary: CoCoALib and CoCoA-5</h2>

<p>
<strong>CoCoA-5</strong> is an easy-to-use interactive system for computations in
commutative algebra; it contains an on-line manual accessible via the
<code>?</code> command.
</p>
<p>
<strong>CoCoALib</strong> is a C++ <em>library</em> of functions for computations in
commutative algebra.
</p>
<p>
This introduction is part of the documentation for <em>CoCoALib</em>;
to use the library you will need some <em>basic knowledge</em> of the C++
programming language.
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc2">
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
The first step is to compile the CoCoA software: see <a href="INSTALL.html"><code>INSTALL</code></a>
</p>

<section id="toc3">
<h3>Using CoCoALib</h3>

<p>
As we know that no one likes to read documentation, the best place to
start is by looking at the <a href="../../examples/index.html">examples/</a>
directory full of sample code using CoCoALib.
</p>

<section id="toc4">
<h4>Writing Your Own Programs</h4>

<p>
To write your own program, first think of a filename in which to
put your code, <em>e.g.</em> <code>MyProg.C</code> -- the name <strong>must end in</strong> <em>dot C</em>.
The simplest next step is to copy the example program <code>ex-empty.C</code>
into <code>MyProg.C</code>, and then modify this copy (see <a href="../../examples/index.html">guide</a>).
The advantage is that <code>ex-empty.C</code> contains several lines of "boilerplate"
code which your program needs to contain.
</p>
<p>
If you want to experiment with CoCoALib using a different directory,
just copy <code>examples/Makefile</code> into your directory and change the line
</p>

<pre>
COCOA_ROOT=...
</pre>

<p>
so that it specifies the full path of <code>CoCoALib-XX</code>, for instance
</p>

<pre>
COCOA_ROOT=/Users/bigatti/CoCoALib-0.99
</pre>

<p>
In any case, it is best to start with a copy of <code>ex-empty.C</code>.
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc5">
<h4>Debugging with CoCoALib</h4>

<p>
CoCoALib does offer some help in tracking down bugs in programs which
use it (and in its own routines).  To enable debugging, you need to
(re-)configure with the option <code>--debug</code>, and then (re-)compile the
library.
</p>
<p>
Once CoCoALib has been configured and compiles with the <code>--debug</code>
option, the preprocessor symbol <code>CoCoA_DEBUG</code> is set.  This symbol
enables various run-time assertions which perform extra checks in many
functions.  You must also (re-)compile your program after enabling
"debugging mode".  You may like to read <a href="./assert.html">assert.html</a> to
learn about <code>CoCoA_ASSERT</code> for use in your own code.
</p>
<p>
In case you are already familiar with the debugger <code>gdb</code>,
"debugging mode" also produces a version of CoCoALib compatible
with <code>gdb</code>.
</p>

<section id="toc6">
<h3>Various Forms of Documentation</h3>

<p>
CoCoALib comes with a collection of hand-written descriptions of its
capabilities as well as a collection of example programs showing how
to use many of the features of the library.  <strong>The hope is that the example</strong>
<strong>programs (plus perhaps a little intelligent guesswork) will suffice to</strong>
<strong>answer most questions about CoCoALib.</strong>  The hand-written documentation is
intended to be more thorough: so less guesswork is needed, but you may
have to plough through lots of tedious text to find the detail you're
looking for.
</p>
<p>
The hand-written documentation is split into many files: generally there is
one file of documentation for each implementation file in the source code.
Furthermore, each file comprises three sections:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>User Documentation</strong>  gives the information a normal user of
  the library may need to know, principally the function interfaces
  offered
</li>
<li><strong>Maintainer Documentation</strong> contains notes and details about how
  the various functions are implemented in the library, essentially
  all information that might be needed to comprehend and maintain the
  code in the future
</li>
<li><strong>Shortcomings, etc</strong> contains sundry notes about the implementation,
  for instance ideas on how the implementation might be improved in the
  future, doubts about certain design choices, and generally any thoughts
  to be taken into consideration for future versions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The source for this documentation is in the CoCoALib directory <code>doc/txt/</code>, and
converted into html (<code>doc/html/</code>) and LaTeX (<code>doc/tex/</code>) using
<a href="http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/"><code>txt2tags</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
A template file fo adding to this documentation and some basic
instructions for <a href="http://txt2tags.sourceforge.net/"><code>txt2tags</code></a> are
in the file <a href="empty.html">doc/txt/empty.txt</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is also some (old?) automatically generated DOXYGEN documentation in
<a href="../doxygen/index.html">doxygen</a>
</p>
<p>
We believe that many simple questions are probably best answered by looking
at the example programs (and perhaps applying a little intelligent guesswork).
The hand-written documentation in the directory <code>doc/</code> is supposed to be
exhaustive (and is doubtless also rather exhausting).  The Doxygen files
will most likely be of use to those already experienced in using CoCoALib.

<h2>Sundry Important Points</h2>

<p>
We have tried to give CoCoALib a <em>natural</em> interface, but this has not always
been possible.  Here are the main problem areas:
</p>

<section~A~>
<h3></h3>
<section id="toc8">
<h4>Powering and Exponentiation</h4>

<p>
The use of the hat symbol (^) to denote exponentiation is very widespread.
<strong>CoCoALib does not allow this</strong> you must use the function <code>power</code> instead.
</p>
<p>
<em>Why not?</em>  Because it would be too easy to write misleading code, <em>i.e.</em>
valid code which does not compute what you would expect.  Here is a simple
example: <code>3*x^2</code> is interpreted by the compiler as <code>(3*x)^2</code>.  Unfortunately
there is no way to make the C++ compiler use the expected interpretation.
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc9">
<h4>Integers and Rationals</h4>

<p>
The C++ language is not designed to compute directly with unlimited
integers or with exact rational numbers; special types (namely <a href="BigInt.html"><code>BigInt</code></a> and
<a href="BigRat.html"><code>BigRat</code></a>) to handle these sorts of values have been added as part of CoCoALib
(with the real work being done by the GMP library).  Nevertheless the user
has to be wary of several pitfalls where code which looks correct at first
glance does not produce the right answer.
</p>

<ul>
<li>rationals must be constructed explicitly, <em>e.g.</em> the expression
  <code>2/3</code> is valid C++ but is interpreted as an integer division
  giving result <code>0</code>; instead the rational must be constructed like
  this <code>BigRat(2,3)</code>.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>large integer constants must be converted from a string
  representation, <em>e.g.</em> <code>n = 99...99;</code> (with 99 nines) will
  probably not even compile because of an error about "integer
  constant too big"; instead such a large value must be handled
  directly by CoCoALib in a call like <code>BigInt("99...99");</code> which
  converts the string into an integer.
<p></p>
</li>
<li>the compiler believes it knows how to perform arithmetic between
  machine integers, but there are two annoying pitfalls: (1)
  the spectre of overflow haunts computations with machine integers;
  (2) expressions like <code>2/3</code> are treated as integer division
  (giving in this case 0, rather than the rational number 2/3).
  To avoid risk of overflow use values of type <a href="BigInt.html"><code>BigInt</code></a>, though
  computations will then be slower than with machine integers.
  If you are <em>quite sure</em> that large values can <em>never occur</em> then it is
  fine to use machine integers; otherwise use unlimited integers.
  Rational numbers have to be created using a constructor call: <em>e.g.</em> <code>BigRat(2,3)</code>.
<p></p>

<li>(AMB: add examples from talk in Kassel)
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting CoCoALib Bugs and other problems</h3>

<p>
Please let us know if you find any bugs in CoCoALib.  Ideally your bug report should include a <strong>small</strong> program
which exhibits the bad behaviour with a clear indication of what you think the
program should do, and where it apparently goes wrong.  The best way to inform
us of the problem is to report an <em>issue</em> on
