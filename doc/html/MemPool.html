<h2>User Documentation for MemPool</h2>

<section id="toc2">
<h3>General description</h3>

<p>
A <code>MemPool</code> provides a simple and fast memory management scheme for
(small) memory blocks of <strong>fixed size</strong>.  It is particularly well-suited to
cases where there are many interleaved allocations and deallocations.  You
probably do not need to know about <code>MemPool</code> unless you plan to write
some <em>low-level</em> code.
</p>
<p>
<code>MemPool</code>s work by acquiring large <em>loaves</em> of memory from the system, and
dividing these loaves into <em>slices</em> of the chosen size.  A simple
free-list of available slices is maintained.  New loaves are acquired
whenever there are no slices available to meet a request.  Note that
the space occupied by the loaves is returned to the system only when
the <code>MemPool</code> object is destroyed.  Also note that a <code>MemPool</code> simply
forwards to <code>::operator new</code> any request for a block of memory of size
different from that specified at the creation of the <code>MemPool</code> object;
wrong size deallocations are similarly forwarded to <code>::operator delete</code>.
</p>
<p>
A <code>MemPool</code> with a large block size will simply forward all alloc/free
requests to the system memory manager (via <code>::operator new</code> and
<code>::operator delete</code>).  Current cut-off size is <code>MaxSliceSize = 128</code> (bytes).
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc3">
<h3>Basic Use</h3>

<p>
The constructor for a <code>MemPool</code> requires that the size (in bytes) of the blocks
it is to manage be specified (as the first argument).  We recommend that the
<code>MemPool</code> be given a name (second argument as a string); the name is useful only
for debugging.  The third argument may occasionally be useful for more advanced use.
</p>

<pre>
 MemPool workspace(16); // 16 byte slices used as temporary workspaces
</pre>

<pre>
 MemPool MemMgr(sizeof(widget), "memmgr for widgets");
</pre>

<p>
Once the <code>MemPool</code> has been created, a new block of memory is obtained via a
call to the member function <code>alloc</code>, and a block of memory is freed via a
call to the member function <code>free</code> (only to be applied to blocks previously
allocated by the same <code>MemPool</code>).  In fact, <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code> have two
variants:
</p>

<pre>
  MemPool::alloc()  allocates a block of the default size for the ``MemPool``

  MemPool::alloc(sz) allocates a block of ``sz`` bytes; if ``sz`` is not the
  default size for the ``MemPool`` the request is passed on to ``::operator new``

  MemPool::free(ptr) frees a default sized block with address ``ptr``

  MemPool::free(ptr, sz) frees a block of ``sz`` bytes with address ptr, if
  ``sz`` is not the default size for the ``MemPool`` the request is passed on to
  ``::operator delete``
</pre>

<p>
The variants taking an explicit block size permit <code>MemPool</code>s to be used by
a class specific operator new/delete pair (see example program below).
In particular, it is not an error to ask a <code>MemPool</code> for a block of memory
whose size differs from the size declared when the <code>MemPool</code> was
constructed; indeed, this is a necessary capability if the <code>MemPool</code> is to
be used inside operator new/delete.  Attempting to <code>alloc</code> too much
memory will result in a <code>std::bad_alloc</code> exception being thrown.
</p>
<p>
If you encounter bugs which may be due to incorrect memory management then
<code>MemPool</code> has some facilities to help you detect various common bugs, and
isolate their true causes.  How to do this is described in the following
section <em>Debugging with MemPools</em>.
</p>
<p>
It is possible to get some crude logging information from a <code>MemPool</code>.  The
global variable <code>MemPoolFast::ourInitialVerbosityLevel</code> indicates the
verbosity level for newly created <code>MemPool</code>s; the verbosity level of
individual <code>MemPool</code> objects may be set explicitly by calling the member
function <code>SetVerbosityLevel</code>.  The various verbosty levels are described
below in the section entitled <em>The Verbosity Levels</em>.
</p>
<p>
Technical note:
<code>MemPool</code> is just a typedef for the true class name <code>MemPoolFast</code>
  (or <code>MemPoolDebug</code> if you enable debugging).
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc4">
<h3>Debugging with MemPools</h3>

<p>
The preprocessor variable <code>CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG</code> can be set at compile-time
to perform run-time checks and obtain debugging information and statistics:
<strong>edit the obvious line</strong> near the top of <code>include/CoCoA/PREPROCESSOR_DEFNS.H</code>.
Note that <strong>recompilation of all source files</strong> depending on <code>MemPool</code> will be
necessary.  When the preprocessor variable is set the typedef <code>MemPool</code>
refers to the class <code>MemPoolDebug</code> -- throughout this section we shall
speak simply of <code>MemPool</code>.
</p>
<p>
Each <code>MemPool</code> object maintains a record of its own level of verbosity and
debug checks.  Upon creation of a new <code>MemPool</code> object these levels are
set automatically to the values of these two global variables:
</p>

<pre>
  MemPoolDebug::ourInitialDebugLevel
  MemPoolDebug::ourInitialVerbosityLevel
</pre>

<p>
The values of these globals should be set <strong>before creating</strong> any MemPools,
<em>i.e.</em> before creating the <code>GlobalManager</code> (which creates the MemPools
for the ring of integers and the rationals).
</p>
<p>
The ostream on which logging data is printed defaults to <code>std::clog</code> but
may be changed to another ostream via a call like <code>MemPoolSetLogStream(LogFile)</code>;
the logging stream is global, <em>i.e.</em> the same for all MemPools.
</p>
<p>
Similarly the ostream on which error logs are printed defaults to <code>std::cerr</code>
but may be changed to another ostream via a call like <code>MemPoolSetErrStream(ErrFile)</code>;
the error stream is global, <em>i.e.</em> the same for all MemPools.
</p>
<p>
After construction of a <code>MemPool</code> object its levels can be adjusted using
the member functions:
</p>

<pre>
  MemPool MemMgr(...);        // construct MemPool
  MemMgr.SetDebugLevel(n);    // change debug level for this object
  MemMgr.SetVerbosityLevel(n);// change verbosity level for this object
</pre>

<p>
You can arrange for a <code>MemPool</code> to print out some summary statistics at
regular intervals.  The interval (in seconds) used for such messages is
approximately the value of
</p>

<pre>
 MemPoolDebug::ourOutputStatusInterval
</pre>

</section>
<section id="toc5">
<h3>The Verbosity Levels</h3>

<p>
To help in debugging and fine tuning, you can get some logging messages out of
a <code>MemPool</code>; these are printed on <code>std::clog</code>.  Here is a
description of the various levels of <em>verbosity</em>:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Level 0</strong></dt><dd>
  No logging information is produced (but error messages may be
  produced if debugging is active, see below)
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Level 1</strong></dt><dd>
  A brief message is produced upon creation of each <code>MemPool</code> object;
  and another upon destruction (including some summary statistics).
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Level 2</strong></dt><dd>
  In addition to level 1: a log message is produced for each new
  loaf allocated by a <code>MemPool</code>, including some summary statistics.
  This may be useful to monitor how much memory is being allocated,
  and how quickly.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Level 3+</strong></dt><dd>
  In addition to level 2: a log message is produced for each
  allocation and deallocation of a block by a <code>MemPool</code>; this can
  be used to isolate memory leaks (see comment below).
</dd>
</dl>

</section>
<section id="toc6">
<h3>Using Verbosity Level 3</h3>

<p>
This is a very verbose level: each allocation/deallocation gives rise to a
printed message (on a single rather long line).  These messages can be
analyzed to help isolate when a leaked block of memory is allocated; or, in
conjunction with debug level 1, it can help find when a block of memory
which is written to after being freed was allocated.  Note that this can
produce enormous amounts of output, so you are advised to send logging
output to a file.  The output may be processed by the program <code>leak_checker</code>
(in this directory) to help track down memory leaks: see the user
documentation in leak_checker.txt
</p>
<p>
Each message about an alloc/free contains a sequence number: there are
separate counts for calls to <code>alloc</code> and calls to <code>free</code>.  If the
leak_checker program indicates that there is no matching <code>free</code> for
the N-th call to <code>alloc</code> then the N-th call to <code>alloc</code> for that
particular <code>MemPoolDebug</code> object can be intercepted easily in a
debugger by setting a breakpoint in the function
<code>MemPoolDebug::intercepted</code>, and by calling the member function
<code>InterceptAlloc</code> with argument N at some point before the N-th call
to <code>alloc</code>.  The N-th call to <code>free</code> can be intercepted in an
analogous way by calling instead the member function
<code>InterceptFree</code>.  It is probably a good idea to call
<code>InterceptAlloc</code> or <code>InterceptFree</code> as soon as you can after the
<code>MemPoolDebug</code> object has been created; of course, recompilation
will be necessary.
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc7">
<h3>Debug Levels in MemPools</h3>

<p>
If CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG was set during compilation then each <code>MemPool</code>
object performs some debug checking.  If the checks reveal a problem then
an error message is printed on <code>GlobalErrput</code>.  Upon creation of a
<code>MemPool</code> object, the debug level is set to the value of the global
variable:
</p>

<pre>
  MemPoolDebug::ourInitialDebugLevel
</pre>

<p>
After creation the debug level can be adjusted by calling the member function
<code>SetDebugLevel</code>; this must be called before the <code>MemPool</code> has allocated any
space.  Any attempts to change the debug level are silently ignored after the
first allocation has been made.
</p>
<p>
Here are the meanings of the different levels of checking: (each higher
level includes all lower levels)
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Level 0</strong></dt><dd>
  A count of the number of allocations, deallocations and <em>active</em> blocks
  is maintained: a block is <em>active</em> if it has been allocated but not
  subsequently freed.  The only check is that the number of active blocks
  is zero when the <code>MemPool</code> object is destroyed; an error message is printed
  out only if there are some active blocks.  This level is rather faster than
  the higher levels of debugging, but should detect the existence of leaked
  memory; higher levels of debugging will probably be necessary to isolate
  the cause of any leak.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Level 1</strong></dt><dd>
  This level should detect several types of common error: writing just outside
  the allocated region, writing to a block shortly after freeing it, perhaps
  reading from a block shortly after freeing it, trying to free a block not
  allocated by the given <code>MemPool</code> object, perhaps reading from an uninitialized
  part of an allocated block.  Freeing a zero pointer via a <code>MemPool</code> is also
  regarded as worthy of a warning.
<p></p>
  When a block of memory is allocated it is filled with certain values
  (including small <em>margins</em> right before and after the requested block).
  The values in the margins are checked when the block is freed: anything
  unexpected produces an error message.  A freed block is immediately
  filled with certain other values to help detect reading/writing to the
  block after it has been freed.  These values are checked when the block
  is next reallocated.
<p></p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Level 2</strong></dt><dd>
  This level has not been tested much.  It will probably be very much slower
  than any lower level, and is intended to help track down cases where a freed
  block is written to some time after it has been freed.  A freed block is
  never reallocated, and all freed blocks are checked for being written to
  each time <code>alloc</code> or <code>free</code> is called; an error message is printed if a
  modified freed block is found.  You need to be pretty desperate to use this
  level.  A corrupted freed block is cleared to its expected <em>free</em> state as
  soon as it is reported -- so persistent writing to a freed block can be
  detected.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Example: Using a MemPool as the memory manager for a class</h3>

<p>
Suppose you already have a class called MyClass.  Here are the changes to
make so that heap-located instances of MyClass reside in slices managed by
a MemPool; obviously stack-located instances cannot be managed by MemPool.
</p>
<p>
Add in the definition of MyClass (typically in the file MyClass.H):
</p>

<pre>
 private:
  static MemPool myMemMgr;

 public:
  static inline void operator delete(void* DeadObject, size_t sz)
  { myMemMgr.free(DeadObject, sz); }
  inline void* operator new(size_t sz)
  { return myMemMgr.alloc(sz); }
</pre>

<p>
The class static variable must be defined in some <code>.C</code> file,
probably MyClass.C is the most suitable choice:
</p>

<pre>
  MemPool MyClass::myMemMgr = MemPool(sizeof(MyClass));
    or
  MemPool MyClass::myMemMgr = MemPool(sizeof(MyClass), PoolName);
    or
  MemPool MyClass::myMemMgr = MemPool(sizeof(MyClass), PoolName, NrWordsInMargin);
</pre>

<p>
<code>PoolName</code> is a string: it is used only in logging and error messages in debugging
  mode, but it might be useful when debugging even when CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG is
  not defined; the default name is <code>Unnamed-MemPool</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>NrWordsInMargin</code> is used only with debugging, and can be used to alter the
  width of the buffer zones placed before and after each slice (default=4).
</p>
<p>
Here is a simple example program showing how <code>MemPool</code>s can be used,
and how the debugging facilities can be employed.  Compile this program
with <code>CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG</code> set, and then run it to see the error
messages produced indicating improper use of memory resources.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#include "CoCoA/MemPool.H"

using CoCoA::MemPool;

<h2>Maintenance notes for the MemPool source code</h2>

<p>
The code for <code>MemPoolFast</code> and <code>MemPoolDebug</code> is exception-safe.  The only
exception this code could cause is <code>std::bad_alloc</code> in the member functions
<code>MakeNewLoaf</code> or by a forwarded call to <code>::operator new</code> inside the member
functions <code>alloc</code>.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>MemPoolFake</code> simply forwards all allocation/deallocation calls
to <code>::operator new/delete</code>.  It was added hastily to enable a threadsafe
compilation (assuming that <code>::operator new</code> and <code>::operator delete</code> are
themselves threadsafe).
</p>
<p>
The idea of <code>MemPool</code>s was taken from <em>Effective C++</em> by Scott Meyers,
but the code here has evolved considerably from what was described
in the book.
</p>
<p>
There are two virtually independent implementations: one for normal use,
and one for use while debugging, the selection between the two versions is
determined by the preprocessor symbol CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG: if this symbol
is undefined then <code>MemPool</code> is a typedef for <code>MemPoolFast</code> otherwise it is
a typedef for <code>MemPoolDebug</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>MemPoolDebug</code> uses internally a <code>MemPoolFast</code> object to handle the genuine
memory management operations while <code>MemPoolDebug</code> performs validity checks
and maintains counters for various sorts of operation.
</p>

<section id="toc10">
<h3>MemPoolFast and loaf</h3>

<p>
The most important member functions of <code>MemPoolFast</code> are <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code>
for slices of the requested size; it is vital that these be fast (on average).
Amazingly, no worthwhile gain in speed was observed when I made these
functions inline; sometimes inline was noticeably slower (g++ oddity?).
Anyway, for simplicity I have kept them out-of-line.
</p>
<p>
The idea behind a <code>MemPoolFast</code> is quite simple: unused slices are strung
together in a <em>free list</em>, the last unused slice contains a null pointer.
So <code>alloc</code> simply returns a pointer to the first slice in the free list,
while <code>free</code> inserts a new slice at the front of the free list.  The ctor
makes sure that each slice is big enough to hold at least a pointer; the
first part of a free slice is used to hold the pointer to the next free
slice (any remaining space in a free slice is unused).
</p>
<p>
Note that there is a conundrum in choosing the right C++ type for the slices
of a loaf, since the values kept in unused slices are pointers to slices, and
there is no C++ type which is a pointer to itself.  The type chosen for these
entries is <code>void**</code>: this conveys the information that they are not pointers
to C++ objects while also allowing pointer arithmetic (which is not allowed on
values of type <code>void*</code>).  Nonetheless the code is necessarily peppered with
casts (to convert a <code>void***</code> into a <code>void**</code>); these are necessarily
<code>reinterpret_cast</code>s but should be absolutely safe since they are only ever
applied to genuine pointers to values (or to the null pointer).  Actually the
<code>reinterpret_cast</code>s could probably be replaced by two nested <code>static_casts</code>s
passing via the type <code>void*</code> but this would not help readability in the
slightest.
</p>
<p>
What happens when a new slice is requested when the free list is empty?  A
new <code>loaf</code> is created, and cut into slices which are linked together to
form a free list.  A <code>loaf</code> is little more than a large chunk of raw memory
acquired from the system (see below for more details).  Note that if
several loaves are in use then the freed slices from different loaves are
strung together in a single free list; no attempt is made to keep slices
from different loaves separate.  In particular, no check is made for a loaf
all of whose slices are unused; loaves are returned to the system only when
the <code>MemPool</code> is destroyed.
</p>
<p>
Most of the data members of <code>MemPoolFast</code> are simple and with an obvious role.
Here are a few observations about aspects which may not be completely obvious.
</p>
<p>
The data member <code>myLoaves</code> is an <code>auto_ptr</code> so that the class dtor can be
simple; it also expresses the idea that the loaves pointed to are owned by
the <code>MemPoolFast</code> object.  Note that each <code>loaf</code> has a next pointer which is
also an <code>auto_ptr</code>, so destroying the first loaf will destroy them all.  I
could not use a <code>std::list</code> because <code>loaf</code> does not have a copy ctor.
</p>
<p>
The data member <code>myFillNewLoaf</code> is used only when a new loaf is created (in
<code>MakeNewLoaf</code>).  If the flag is set, the slices in a new loaf are filled with
the sentinel value expected by <code>MemPoolDebug</code>, i.e. <code>MEMPOOL_FREE_WORD</code>.
This seemed the least obnoxious way of achieving the necessary behaviour.
</p>
<p>
The data member <code>myVerbosityLevel</code> was added to allow some minimal logging
of resource consumption even with <code>MemPoolFast</code> objects: a brief message is
output whenever a new loaf is acquired.  It does complicate the class rather,
but may be useful sometimes.
</p>
<p>
The only member functions exhibiting some complexity are:
<code>myOutputStatus</code> uses a loop to count how many freed slices there are in
      each loaf, and the print out the results in <code>GlobalLogput</code>.
</p>
<p>
<code>MakeNewLoaf</code> first decides roughly how many slices the new loaf should have;
      creates the loaf, and inserts at the front of the list of loaves;
      prints out a logging message if required.
</p>
<p>
The separation of the class <code>loaf</code> from the class <code>MemPoolFast</code> is partly a
historical accident -- a side-effect of the tortuous search for a tolerably
clean implementation.  Overall, I regard it as a fairly happy accident because
no details of the the class <code>loaf</code> are visible in the header file.
</p>
<p>
The class <code>loaf</code> has a simple primary role: it owns the raw memory acquired
from the system.  Destroying a <code>loaf</code> returns the raw memory to the system.
Unfortunately the implementation became rather complicated.  Each <code>loaf</code>
contains a <em>next pointer</em> so that <code>loaf</code>s can be linked together in a list.
I could not use a <code>std::list</code> since a <code>loaf</code> does not have a copy ctor (nor
assignment); I prefer not to play dangerous games with copy ctors which
destroy their arguments (non-standard semantics), and a clean copy ctor
would probably be horribly inefficient.  The <em>next pointer</em> is an <code>auto_ptr</code>
so that destroying the first <code>loaf</code> in a list will actually destroy all of
the <code>loaf</code>s in that list.
</p>
<p>
To fulfil a request for logging information about utilization of slices in
each <code>loaf</code>, I added four member functions:
</p>

<pre>
  IamOriginator      - true iff arg points to a slice of this loaf
  myFreeCounterReset - reset counters to zero in this loaf list
  myCountFreeSlice   - incr my counter if slice is mine, o/w pass to next loaf
  myOutputStatus     - print out utilization stats.
</pre>

<p>
Apart from <code>IamOriginator</code>, I would much rather these functions did not exist.
</p>
<p>
The implementation of a <code>loaf</code> is straightforward (but a bit messy).
</p>

<h3>MemPoolDebug</h3>

<p>
The idea behind <code>MemPoolDebug</code> is that it should offer the same interface
as <code>MemPoolFast</code> but will additionally perform validity checks and
accumulate utilization statistics and print logging messages (if
requested).  The implementation is quite straightforward but rather long
and messy as the code offers several levels of debug checks and logging
message verbosity.
</p>
<p>
The idea behind a <code>MemPoolDebug</code> is that it manages slices in a manner
which should help uncover incorrect use of memory: a newly allocated
slice is filled with peculiar values (in case you read without first
writing a sensible value there), a freed slice is immediately filled
with an other peculiar value (in case you read after freeing), each
slice has a small protective margin right before and after it (in case
you write just outside the valid address range)...
(the fill values are intended to be invalid as pointers, to help detect
pointer following in <em>uninitialized memory</em>)
</p>
<p>
A count is kept of the number of <code>alloc</code> and <code>free</code> calls.  This can
help discover that some value was never freed, or maybe was freed twice.
These counts are of type <code>size_t</code>, so they could overflow; but then
you'd be a bit daft to try to debug such a large example, wouldn't you?
</p>
<p>
The default initial debugging and verbosity levels can be modified by
setting the values of certain global variables -- these value are respected
only if you compiled with <code>CoCoA_MEMPOOL_DEBUG</code> set or if you used
explicitly the class <code>MemPoolDebug</code> rather than the typedef <code>MemPool</code>.
These values are consulted only when a <code>MemPoolDebug</code> object is created.
Using global variables like this make its easy to vary the debug level
(without having to recompile the whole library).
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>MemPoolDebug::ourInitialVerbosityLevel</code>
       default verbosity level
</li>
<li><code>MemPoolDebug::ourInitialDebugLevel</code>
       default debug level
</li>
<li><code>MemPoolDebug::ourDefaultMarginSize</code>
       default margin size (see below)
</li>
<li><code>MemPoolDebug::ourOutputStatusInterval</code>
       print utilization statistics at roughly this interval (in seconds)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All the genuine memory management operations are handled by <code>myMemMgr</code>,
a <code>MemPoolFast</code> object belonging to the <code>MemPoolDebug</code> object.  This
approach avoids having two similar copies of rather delicate code.
</p>
<p>
The margin size must be fixed in the ctor because <code>myMemMgr</code> needs to know
what size slices it must manage.  The margin size for a <code>MemPoolDebug</code>
object cannot be changed later.  Distinct <code>MemPoolDebug</code> objects may
have different margin sizes.
</p>
<p>
The debug level may be changed after construction provided no slices have
been issued; trying to make the various debug levels compatible would
require very careful checking (which I cannot be bothered to do).
</p>
<p>
The verbosity level can be changed at any time (since there is no reason
not to allow this).
</p>
<p>
The data member <code>myAliveOrDead</code> was added to help protect against attempts
to use an already deleted <code>MemPoolDebug</code> object.  All public member
functions check that the field <code>myAliveOrDead</code> contains the expected value
before proceeding: a CoCoALib error is thrown if the value is wrong.  The
correct value for a live <code>MemPoolDebug</code> object is the constant
<code>MemPoolDebug::AliveMark</code>.
</p>
<p>
The data member <code>myHeadOfUsedList</code> is used at the highest level of debugging.
All freed slices are placed on this list so they cannot be reissued to the
user.  Every call then scans all these freed slices to make sure they contain
the correct fill value.  This is intended to help discover writes to freed
memory long after the slice has been freed.  This level gets very slow on larger
examples.

2020-12-03: added auto-forwarding to system mem mgr for large blocks.
</p>
<p>
Idea for better locality of reference: keep two free lists, one for the
most recent loaf, and one for all older loaves.  When most recent loaf
fills up, create and use a new loaf unless the free list for all the
older loaves exceeds 0.5 times the size of the most recent loaf.  Not
sure what to do if the freelist for old loaves is very long.
</p>
<p>
Add a new member function which <em>tidies up</em> the list of freed blocks?
This might lead to better locality of reference, and ultimately to
better run-time performance if called judiciously.
</p>
<p>
Could it be worth trying to help preserve locality of reference?
Maybe freed slices could be returned to their own loaves.  Properly
nested alloc/free calls ought to preserve locality anyway.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the globals <code>ourInitialDebugLevel</code> and <code>ourInitialVerbosityLevel</code>
could be set inside the ctor for <code>GlobalManager</code>??
</p>
<p>
Member functions of <code>MemPoolFast/Debug</code> do not have names in accordance
with the coding conventions.  Cannot decide when I should use <code>void*</code>
and when I should use <code>slice_t</code> for the arg types.
</p>
<p>
A potentially useful function could be one which tells the MemPool to
check that it is empty (i.e. all allocated blocks have been freed).
This is currently implicit in the debugging-mode dtor.
</p>
<p>
It might be an idea to maintain a registry of all existing MemPools,
so that they can be told towards the end of the run that they should
all be empty.  Otherwise any MemPool which is never destroyed can
never give an indication of any leaks of its own slices.
</p>
<p>
Could there be alignment problems with funny margin sizes?
What about machines where pointers are a different size from <code>int</code>s?
</p>
<p>
The code may silently increase the size of requested blocks so that their
lengths are integer multiples of the size of a <code>slice_t</code>.  This does mean
that writes outside the requested block but within the silently extended
block are not detected (in debugging mode) -- I guess that most block sizes
are exact multiples anyway, so there is unlikely to be any problem in most
practical situations.
</p>
<p>
Is the function <code>AlreadyFreed</code> working as one would expect?  Currently
it checks that the margins are those of a freed block, and uses that
as the determining criterion.  The argument is that an attempt to
free a block suggests that user probably thought it hadn't been freed
and so the user accessible data area is quite probably corrupted
(i.e. not simply full of <code>MEMPOOL_FREE_WORD</code> values).  I have also
added a call to <code>OverwriteFreeCheck</code>, so that freeing an overwritten
already freed block will cause two error messages to be printed.
Previously, <code>AlreadyFreed</code> required that the data area be in tact for
the block to count as already having been freed; an overwritten
freed block would then be detected as an allocated block with
corrupted margins.  Maybe a memory map for an overwritten freed
block would be a useful addition? (similar to that produced for
an allocated block with corrupt margins).
</p>
<p>
The periodical printing of stats is rather crude.  To make it more
sophisticated will just made the code even more complex though (sigh).
</p>
<p>
<code>AutoPtrSlice</code> is still very experimental.
