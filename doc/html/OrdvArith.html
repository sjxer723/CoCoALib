<h2>User documentation for OrdvArith</h2>

<p>
<code>OrdvArith</code> objects are "low level" values, and thus probably of
little interest to most users of CoCoALib.  They perform arithmetic
operations on <code>OrdvElem</code> values, <em>i.e.</em> compressed vectors of
non-negative small integers (which represent "order vectors" of power
products).  The main aim is fast multiplication and comparison of two
power products (using a specified PP ordering -- see <a href="PPOrdering.html"><code>PPOrdering</code></a>).
</p>
<p>
All operations on <code>OrdvElem</code> values must be effected through an
explicit <code>OrdvArith</code> member function call; this design is similar to
that of <code>ring</code>s and <code>RingElem</code>s.  The main design aim was speed
rather than convenience; as a consequence the member fns listed below
expect the caller to have allocated the memory used to contain the
results of computations (<em>e.g.</em> in the parameter <code>ordv</code>).
</p>

<section id="toc2">
<h3>Initializers and Converters for OrdvElem</h3>

<p>
These fns are all member fns of <code>OrdvArith</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>myAssignZero(ordv)</code>  set <code>ordv</code> to all zeros
</li>
<li><code>myAssignFromExpv(ordv, expv)</code>  set <code>ordv</code> from given exponent vector <code>expv</code>
</li>
<li><code>myComputeExpv(expv, ordv)</code>  extract exponent vector from <code>ordv</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: the two functions which convert between <code>expv</code> and <code>ordv</code>
    representations might be quite slow, especially if a general
    ordering is used.  Even with the simplest ordering (<em>i.e.</em> lex)
    the conversion is not instant because order vectors are held in a
    packed representation.

<h3>Arithmetic operations on OrdvElem</h3>

<p>
These fns are all member fns of <code>OrdvArith</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>myMul(ordv, ordv1, ordv2)</code>  put into <code>ordv</code> product of <code>ordv1</code> and <code>ordv2</code>

</li>
<li><code>myPower(ordv, ordv1, n)</code>  put into <code>ordv</code> the <code>n</code>-th power of <code>ordv1</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: since order vectors are linearly related to exponent vectors, the
    functions <code>myMul</code> and <code>myDiv</code> actually compute the sum and difference of the
    order vectors.  No check is made for over-/under-flow!

<h4>Background about matrices and PP orderings</h4>

<p>
This section is for the curious.
</p>
<p>
To better understand the what an <code>OrdvArith</code> object does, let us begin by
setting the scene.  We recall that for all practical purposes an arithmetic
ordering on power products can be specified by a matrix of integers <code>M</code> as
follows:
  Let <code>t1 = x_1^e_1 * x_2^e_2 * ... * x_n^e_n</code> be a power product,
  and <code>t2 = x_1^f_1 * x_2^f_2 * ... * x_n^f_n</code> be another.
  Then we call <code>(e_1, e_2,..., e_n)</code> the <strong>exponent vector</strong> for <code>t1</code>,
  and similarly for <code>t2</code>.  For brevity we shall write <code>expv(t1)</code>, etc.
</p>
<p>
  The matrix <code>M</code> determines the ordering thus:  we say that
  <code>t1 &lt; t2</code>  iff  <code>M*expv(t1)</code> comes before <code>M*expv(t2)</code> in lex ordering.
  We call the product <code>M*expv(t1)</code> the <strong>order vector</strong> for <code>t1</code>, and for
  brevity we shall write <code>ordv(t1)</code> to denote it; similarly for <code>t2</code>.
</p>
<p>
Typically the matrix <code>M</code> is subject to some suitability criteria, <em>e.g.</em> <code>M</code>
should be square and invertible.  We shall assume henceforth that <code>M</code> has
been chosen so that all order vectors contain only non-negative entries.
While reading the rest of these notes it may be convenient to think of <code>M</code> as
being non-singular, so that there is a 1-1 correspondence between power
products and their order vectors.
</p>
<p>
Now the scene has been set, we can explain what an <code>OrdvArith</code> object does.
It can effect the conversion from <em>exponent vector</em> to <em>order vector</em>,
and <em>vice versa</em>.  It can also operate directly on order vectors.
Certain special orderings are recognized, so that special relationships
between the exponent vector and order vector can be exploited to enable
faster computation.

<h2>Maintainer documentation for OrdvArith</h2>

<p>
See subsection below about thread-safety!
</p>
<p>
The base class <code>OrdvArith::base</code> just contains several handy values
related to the number of indets and the packing mechanism.  The ctor
does some sanity checking on the supplied parameters, and computes
some handy values for packing/unpacking vectors.
</p>
<p>
Mem fns <code>myMul</code>, <code>myDiv</code> and <code>myCmp</code> are inline for speed.  Recall
that <code>myMul</code> and <code>myDiv</code> do not check for over-/under-flow (for speed).
</p>
<p>
The mem fns <code>myCompress</code> and <code>myDecompress</code> have to check whether
<code>myPackingDensity</code> is 1 because C++ shift operators work "strangely"
if the shift size equals the wordsize.
</p>
<p>
There are several derived classes which supply efficient "short-cut"
impls for some operations when specific knowledge of the ordering
permits this.
</p>
<p>
Data member <code>myNumIndets</code> is required when dealing with exponent vectors
(since C vectors do not record their own length).  It is the number of
valid entries in a C vector representing an exponent vector.
</p>
<p>
Data member <code>myGradingDim</code> specifies how many initial components of an order
vector comprise the grading.  It is needed in <code>myWDeg</code>.
</p>
<p>
Data member <code>myOrdvWords</code> is used only to supply the return value to the
friend function <code>OrdvWords</code>.  This value is needed so that a caller can
allocate the correct amount of space in which to build a new order vector
value.  By default this is initialized to a huge value, so that it will
quickly become evident at run-time if it hasn't been initialized to a sane
value.
</p>
<p>
Data member <code>myOrdvWordsForCmp</code> is used in <code>myMul</code>, <code>myDiv</code> and <code>myCmp</code> to choose
between an inline function and a virtual call.  Its value may be non-zero
and different from <code>myOrdvWords</code> if a redundant representation is being used
(<em>e.g.</em> for a <code>StdDegRevLex</code> ordering).  By default this is initialized to a huge
value, so that it will quickly become evident at run-time if it hasn't been
initialized to a sane value.
</p>
<p>
The member functions <code>myMul</code>, <code>myDiv</code>, and <code>myCmp</code> are non-virtual so that the
compiler can implement them inline: at run-tme they check the data member
<code>myOrdvWordsForCmp</code> to decide whether to the use the inline function or
delegate to a "shadow" virtual function.  This rather ugly arrangement was
necessary to achieve acceptable run-time performance.
</p>
<p>
The member function <code>myMulIndetPower</code> is not pure because a reasonable
generic implementation exists.  Similarly, myOutput(OMOut, ordv) is not pure.

<h4>Threadsafety and CoCoA_THREADSAFE_HACK</h4>

<p>
The code contains some <code>#if</code> blocks to distinguish between
single-threaded and multi-threaded run-time environments.  In a
single-threaded environment the base class contains two "global"
buffers used when converting between exponent vectors and compressed
order vectors; in a multi-threaded environment these buffers are not
used, but each function needing to do such conversions creates
appropriate buffers in local variables (so there are lots of #if
directives).

<h2>Bugs, Shortcomings and other ideas</h2>

<p>
In some ways, <code>myCmp</code> could simply be operator(); thus calls would look
like <code>ord(ordv1, ordv2)</code> where ord is an object of type PPOrdering.
</p>
<p>
We need a way to handle order vectors which have large integer entries!
(also ordering matrices with large integer entries).
Recall that some ordvs may involve <code>mpz_t</code> integers!
Note that the polynomial type needs to know how big an ordv can be: that's what
the <code>OrdvWords</code> member function is for.
</p>
<p>
Should <code>StdDegRevLex</code> actually store an extra component so that <code>deg(...,x[0])</code>
can be calculated easily?  Do we really need this to be quick?  It would be
needed for computing GCDs, testing divisibility etc, but these operations
would normally be done only on "rich PP" objects -- talk to Anna!
</p>
<p>
The restriction to order compatible gradings may not be wholly necessary.
The PPs in a polynomial homogeneous with respect to a k-dimensional grading
are completely specified by n-k of the entries in the order vector, though
precisely which entries must be retained depends on the grading and the
ordering.  Thus a later generalization to non order compatible gradings
may not be too painful.
</p>
<p>
ANNA: must add a section about modular order matrix
JOHN: yes, you must!  Where does 46336 come from???
</p>
<p>
The default implementation of <code>myIsIndet</code> is not very efficient, but is it
really worth writing many different (efficient) implementations?
