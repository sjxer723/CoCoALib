<h2>User documentation</h2>

<p>
<code>debug_new.C</code> is distributed with CoCoALib, but is not really part of the
library proper.  Together with the standalone program <a href="leak_checker.html"><code>leak_checker</code></a>
it can help identify incorrect memory use (<em>e.g.</em> leaks).
If you want to use <code>debug_new</code> to find a memory use problem, you may find it
enough simply to see the section <strong>Example</strong> below.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of <code>debug_new</code> is to assist in tracking down memory use problems:
most particularly leaks and writing just outside the block allocated; it is
<strong>not currently able</strong> to help in detecting writes to deleted blocks.  It works
by intercepting all calls to global <code>new/delete</code>.  Memory blocks are given
small <em>margins</em> (invisible to the user) which are used to help detect
writes just outside the legitimately allocated block.
</p>
<p>
<code>debug_new</code> works by printing out a log message for every memory allocation and
deallocation.  Error messages are printed whenever something awry has been
found.  The output can easily become enormous, so it is best to send the
output to a file.  All log messages start with the string
</p>

<pre>
    [debug_new]
</pre>

<p>
and error messages start with the string
</p>

<pre>
    [debug_new] ERROR
</pre>

<p>
so they can be found easily.  Most messages include a brief summary of the
amount of memory currently in use, the total amount allocated and deallocated,
and the maximum amount of memory in use up to that point.
</p>

<section id="toc2">
<h3>Finding memory leaks</h3>

<p>
To use <code>debug_new</code> to help track down memory leaks, you must employ the
program called <code>leak_checker</code> (included in this distribution) to process
the output produced by your program linked with <code>debug_new.o</code>.  See
<a href="leak_checker.html"><code>leak_checker</code></a> for full details.  Your program output should be put in
a file, say called <em>memchk</em>.  Then executing <code>leak_checker memchk</code> will
print out a summary of how many <code>alloc/free</code> messages were found, and how
many unpaired ones were found.  The file <em>memchk</em> is modified if
unpaired alloc/free messages were found: an exclamation mark is placed
immediately after the word <code>ALLOC</code> (where previously there was a space),
thus a search for <code>ALLOC!</code> will find all unpaired allocation messages.
</p>
<p>
Each call to <code>new/delete</code> is given a sequence number (printed as <code>seq=...</code>).
This information can be used when debugging.  Suppose, for instance, that
<code>leak_checker</code> discovers that the 500th call to <code>new</code> never had a matching
<code>delete</code>.  At the start of your program (<em>e.g.</em> I suggest immediately after you
created the <code>debug_new::PrintTrace</code> object) insert a call to
</p>

<pre>
        debug_new::InterceptNew(500);
</pre>

<p>
Now use the debugger to set a breakpoint in <code>debug_new::intercepted</code> and start
your program.  The breakpoint will be reached during the 500th call to <code>new</code>.
Examining the running program's stack should fairly quickly identify
precisely who requested the memory that was never returned.  Obviously it is
necessary to compile your program as well as <code>debug_new.C</code> with the debugger
option set before using the debugger!
</p>
<p>
Analogously there is a function <code>debug_new::InterceptDelete(N)</code>
which calls <code>debug_new::intercepted</code> during the Nth call to <code>operator delete</code>.
</p>

</section>
<section id="toc3">
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>
Try detecting the (obvious) memory problems in this program.
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include "CoCoA/debug_new.H"

int main()
{
  debug_new::PrintTrace TraceNewAndDelete; // merely activates logging of new/delete
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Starting main" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  int* pi1 = new int(1);
  int* pi2 = new int(2);
  pi1[4] = 17;
  pi1 = pi2;
  delete pi2;
  delete pi1;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "Ending main" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Make sure that <code>debug_new.o</code> exists (<em>i.e.</em> the <code>debug_new</code> program has been
compiled).  Compile this program, and link with <code>debug_new.o</code>.  For instance,
if the program is in the file <code>prog.C</code> then a command like this should suffice:
</p>

<pre>
  g++ -g -ICoCoALib/include prog.C -o prog debug_new.o
</pre>

<p>
Now run <code>./prog &gt;&amp; memchk</code> and see the debugging messages printed out into
<em>memchk</em>; note that the debugging messages are printed on <code>cerr/stderr</code> (hence
the use of <code>&gt;&amp;</code> to redirect the output).  In this case the output is
relatively brief, but it can be huge, so it is best to send it to a file.
Now look at the messages printed in <em>memchk</em>.
</p>
<p>
The <em>probable double delete</em> is easily detected: it happens in the second call
to <code>delete</code> (<code>seq=2</code>).  We locate the troublesome call to delete by adding a line
in main immediately after the declaration of the <code>TraceNewAndDelete</code> local variable
</p>

<pre>
  debug_new::InterceptDelete(2); // intercept 2nd call to delete
</pre>

<p>
Now recompile, and use the debugger to trap execution in the function
<code>debug_new::intercepted</code>, then start the program running under the debugger.
When the trap springs, we can walk up the call stack and quickly learn that
<code>delete pi1;</code> is the culprit.  We can also see that the value of <code>pi1</code> at the
time it was deleted is equal the value originally assigned to <code>pi2</code>.
</p>
<p>
Let's pretend that it is not obvious why <code>delete pi1;</code> should cause
trouble.  So we must investigate further to find the cause.  Here is what
we can do.  Comment out the troublesome delete (<em>i.e.</em> <code>delete pi1;</code>), and
also the call to <code>InterceptDelete</code>.  Recompile and run again, sending all the
output into the file <em>memchk</em> (the previous contents are now old hat).  Now
run the <a href="leak_checker.html"><code>leak_checker</code></a> program on the file <em>memchk</em> using this command:
(make sure <code>leak_checker</code> has been compiled: <code>g++ leak_checker.C -o leak_checker</code>)
</p>

<pre>
 ./leak_checker memchk
</pre>

<p>
It will print out a short summary of the <code>new/delete</code> logs it has found, including
a message that some unmatched calls exist.  By following the instructions in
<a href="leak_checker.html"><code>leak_checker</code></a> we discover that the unfreed block is the one allocated in the
line <code>... pi1 = new ...</code>.  Combining this information with the <em>double delete</em>
error for the line <code>delete pi1</code> we can conclude that the pointer <code>pi1</code> has been
overwritten with the value of <code>pi2</code> somewhere.  At this point <code>debug_new</code> and
<code>leak_checker</code> can give no further help, and you must use other means to locate
where the value gets overwritten (e.g. the <em>watch</em> facility of gdb; try it!).
</p>
<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong> <code>debug_new</code> handles <strong>all</strong> <code>new/delete</code> requests including those arising
from the initialization of static variables within functions (and also
those arising from within the system libraries).  The <a href="leak_checker.html"><code>leak_checker</code></a> program
will mark these as unfreed blocks because they are freed only after main
has exited (and so cannot be tracked by <code>debug_new</code>).
</p>

<h2>Maintainer documentation</h2>

<p>
This file redefines the C++ global operators <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code>.  All
requests to allocate or deallocate memory pass through these functions
which perform some sanity checks, pass the actual request for memory
management to <code>malloc/free</code>, and print out a message.
</p>
<p>
Each block requested is increased in size by placing <em>margins</em> both before
and after the block of memory the user will be given.  The size of these
margins is determined by the compile-time (positive, even) integer constant
<code>debug_new::MARGIN</code>; note that the number of bytes in a margin is this value
multiplied by <code>sizeof(int)</code>.  A margin is placed both before and after each
allocated block handed to the user; the margins are invisible to the user.
Indeed the user's block size is rounded up to the next multiple of
<code>sizeof(int)</code> for convenience.
</p>
<p>
The block+margins obtained from the system is viewed as an integer array,
and the sizes for the margins and user block are such that the boundaries
are aligned with the boundaries between integers in the array -- this
simplifies the code a bit (could have used <code>chars</code>?).  Each block immediately
prior to being handed to the user is filled with certain values: currently
<code>1234567890</code> is placed in each margin integer and <code>-999999999</code> is placed in
each integer inside the user's block.  Upon freeing, the code checks that
the values in the margins are unchanged, thus probably detecting any
accidental writes just outside the allocated block.  Should any value be
incorrect an error message is printed.  The freed block is then
overwritten with other values to help detect accidental "posthumous" read
accesses to data that used to be in the block before it was freed.
</p>
<p>
For our use, the size of the block (the size in bytes as requested by the
user) is stored in the very first integer in the array.  A simplistic
sanity check is made of the value found there when the block is freed.  The
aim is not to be immune to a hostile user, but merely to help track down
common memory usage errors (with high probability, and at tolerable run-time
cost).  This method for storing the block size requires that the margins be
at least as large as a machine integer (probably ought to use <code>size_t</code>).
</p>
<p>
Note the many checks for when to call <code>debug_new::intercepted</code>; maybe
the code should be restructured to reduce the number of these
checks and calls?

<h2>Shortcomings, bugs, etc</h2>

<p>
<strong>WARNING</strong> <code>debug_new</code> handles calls only to plain <code>new</code> and plain <code>delete</code>; it
does not handle calls to <code>new(nothrow)</code> nor to <code>delete(nothrow)</code>, nor to
any of the array versions.
</p>
<p>
Have to recompile to use the <code>debug_new::PrintTrace</code> to turn on printing.
Maybe the first few messages could be buffered up and printed only when
the buffer is full; this might buy enough time to bypass the set up
phase of <code>cerr</code>?
</p>
<p>
Big trouble will probably occur if a user should overwrite the block
size held in the margin of an allocated block.  It seems extremely hard
to protect against such corruption.
</p>
<p>
When a corrupted margin is found a printed memory map could be nice
(compare with what <a href="MemPool.html"><code>MemPool</code></a> does).
</p>
<p>
An allocated block may be slightly enlarged so that its size is a whole
multiple of <code>sizeof(int)</code>.  If the block is enlarged then any write
outside the requested block size but within the enlarged block is not
detected.  This could be fixed by using a <code>char</code> as the basic chunk of
memory rather than an <code>int</code>.  It is rather unclear why <code>int</code> was chosen,
perhaps for reasons of speed?  Or to avoid alignment problems?
</p>
<p>
Could there be problems on machines where pointers are larger than
<code>int</code>s (esp. if the margin size is set to 1)?  There could also be
alignment problems if the margin size is not a multiple of the
size of the type which has the most restrictive alignment criteria.
</p>
<p>
Is it right that the debugging output and error messages are printed
on <code>cerr</code>?  Can/Should we allow the user to choose?  Using <code>cout</code> has
given some trouble since it may call <code>new</code> internally for buffering:
this seemed to yield an infinite loop, and anyway it is a nasty thought
using the <code>cout</code> object to print while it was trying to increase an
internal buffer.
</p>
<p>
The code does not enable one to detect easily writes to freed memory.
This could be enabled by never freeing memory, and instead filling the
freed blocks with known values and then monitoring for changes to these
values in freed blocks.  This could readily become very costly.
