== User documentation ==
%======================================================================

**Normaliz** is a tool for computations in affine monoids, vector
configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones.

Here we should include the manual for the normaliz flags/functions,
but we wait until **libnormaliz** interface is more stable.  For the
moment look at the examples for available functions on
``NormalizCone``s and setting flags.

=== Examples ===
- [ex-Normaliz1.C ../../examples/index.html#ex-Normaliz1.C]
- [ex-Normaliz2.C ../../examples/index.html#ex-Normaliz2.C]


=== Download and compile Normaliz ===

 | [**libnormaliz** website https://www.normaliz.uni-osnabrueck.de/]

Download and compile **Normaliz** following the instructions from the website.

Altenatively, you can download the sources from Github:
First time
``` git clone https://github.com/Normaliz/Normaliz.git
Update (from the Normaliz git folder)
``` git pull

==== Compilation suggestions ====

(**2022-09-15** -- normaliz-3.9.4)

This description covers two cases: standard system installation, and personal installation.
We recommend you use the standard system installation if you can (//i.e.// if you are
permitted to use the ``sudo`` command).

For a system installation do the following:
```
cd normaliz-3.9.4
./configure  --disable-openmp
make -j2      #JAA:  took about 4 mins single-threaded
make check    #JAA: recommended
sudo make install  # This will request your password!
```

*NOTE*: Anna gets the following (harmless?) error when doing ``make check``
``` clang: error: no such file or directory: '/usr/local/lib/libgmp.dylib'


===== Specific version of GMP =====

Normaliz requires the GMP library (with GMPXX too?).
If you want Normaliz to use a specific installation of GMP
try setting ``GMP_INSTALLDIR`` or using the configuration
option ``--with-gmp=...``
```
cd normaliz-3.9.4
export GMP_INSTALLDIR=/usr/local # if GMP is in /usr/local/lib/libgmp.a
./configure  --disable-openmp  --with-gmp=$HOME/MySoftware
...etc...
```

If you want to use a personal installation of GMP
(see [[ExternalLibs-GMP]])

==== Personal installation of libnormaliz ====

First decide where you want libnormaliz to be installed;
I use the directory ``/home/abbott/ExternalLibs/``.
Below I shall write ``<install-dir>`` to mean the directory
you have chosen
```
cd normaliz-3.9.4
./configure  --disable-openmp  --prefix=<install-dir>
# JAA also specified  --disable-shared  in line above
make -j2      #JAA:  took about 4 mins single-threaded
make check    #JAA: recommended
make install
```

The lib file ``libnormaliz.a`` is in ``<install-dir>/lib/``;
so **when you configure CoCoALib** you must give the full path
``--with-libnormaliz=<install-dir>/lib/libnormaliz.a``



==== More normaliz configuration options ====

I used also ``--disable-shared`` (but do not use ``--disable-static``).

For more normaliz configuration options type ``./configure --help``.



==== Compilation suggestions for desperate cases ====

**NEEDS UPDATING**
Must put ``libnormaliz.a`` in ``<install-dir>/lib`` and headers in
``<install-dir>/include``.  Poking around inside the normaliz source
tree is not allowed any more!

**Anna:** I still have problems on MSWindows/cygwin.
Thanks to Winfried Bruns' support, this is what worked out in my desperate case:
I added in ``source/Makefile.configuration``
``-L/home/cocoa/GMP/lib/`` and ``-I/home/cocoa/GMP/include``
then executed in ``source``:
``` make -f Makefile.classic  OPENMP=no  NAKED=yes
This produced ``libnormaliz.a`` in ``libnormaliz/``.
Then I did
```
mkdir .libs
mv libnormaliz/libnormaliz.a ./libs/
```

=== Compile CoCoALib with Normaliz ===

Then configure and compile **CoCoALib** typing
``` 
cd CoCoALib-0.99
./configure  --with-libnormaliz=<your_path_to>/libnormaliz.a
make
```

2022-09-16: We hope soon to permit CoCoALib configuration with the option
``./configure  --with-libnormaliz`` for a standard system installation.

==== Some VERY old instructions -- might still be useful? ====

*2022-09-16*

**IMPORTANT**

We are now "deprecating" using external libs which have been installed.
If a system-wide installation is not possible (//e.g.// the user cannot
run ``sudo``) then a personal installation should be made in a directory
inside the user's filespace.  The notes below were relevant when we
previously would allow use of non-installed external libs.


*2020-03-20*

Anna: I had problems so I did this
```
./configure --with-gmp=/Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.2/ --enable-openmp=no --enable-shared=no --enable-fast-install=no --disable-libtool-lock 
  <adjusted gmp path for include and lib in source/Makefile >
cd source
make
```
Then I have ``libnormaliz.a`` in ``.libs`` and that's all I need for cocoa.

*OLD* (but I don't dare deleting it yet)

I had problems following the given instructions, so I
added
```
GMPFLAGS = -I /Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.2/ -L/Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.2/.libs -lgmpxx -lgmp
```
to ``source/Makefile.configuration`` and then
compiled with 
```OPENMP=no  make -f Makefile.classic
Then I get the error
```
ld: library not found for -lcrt0.o
```
which is solved by removing ``-static`` from the last command, for example:
```
g++  -I /Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.0/ -L/Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.0/.libs -lgmpxx -lgmp -I /Users/bigatti/0.99/boost_1_61_0/ -L/Users/bigatti/0.99/boost_1_61_0/libs -std=c++11 -Wall -pedantic -O3 -funroll-loops -g        -Wno-unknown-pragmas   -I .  normaliz.o libnormaliz/libnormaliz.a  -I /Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.0/ -L/Users/bigatti/0.99/gmp-6.1.0/.libs -lgmpxx -lgmp -I /Users/bigatti/0.99/boost_1_61_0/ -L/Users/bigatti/0.99/boost_1_61_0/libs -o normaliz
```


== Bugs, shortcomings and other ideas ==
%======================================================================

We are still updating CoCoALib configuraton to use properly installed
external libs.


== Main changes ==
