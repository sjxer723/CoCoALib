%======================================================================

**BOOST** (filesystem, system) is an **essential** external library for CoCoA-5.

**BOOST is not used at all in CoCoALib.**  Currently (2022-12-14) BOOST is also
not required for any of the optional external libraries.


If you are lucky BOOST (or the necessary parts of it) are already installed
on your computer.  The CoCoA ``configure`` script should find it automatically
(and will check that all required sub-libraries are present).

If you are not so lucky, you will have to install BOOST yourself.
There are two approaches: use a package manager, or download the sources
and compile BOOST yourself.  Using the package manager is likely simpler
and quicker, but you will probably need "administrator rights".


=== Install BOOST via Package Manager on Linux ===

Different GNU/Linux systems have different package managers.
Here we assume use of ``apt-get``; hopefully this suffices for most users.

``` sudo  apt-get  install  libboost-dev  libboost-doc  libboost-filesystem-dev  libboost-system-dev



=== Download and compile BOOST ===

You can download the BOOST sources from ``http://www.boost.org/``.
Current version is 1.81, and is about 135Mbytes.

It is simplest to make a complete BOOST installation; that way you are
sure to have everything you need -- but a full build can take a while,
and occupy quite a lot of space on your disk.

Alternatively, you can try building just those sub-libraries needed by CoCoA-5;
at the moment CoCoA-5 uses the following BOOST sub-libraries:
``filesystem`` and   ``system``.

To build BOOST first use their script ``bootstrap.sh``, then use the script ``b2``.

==== Special note for users of old MacBooks ====

The ``b2`` script requires some extra options, so in the examples below
**insert these extra two options**

``` ./b2  architecture=x86  address-model=32_64  <remaining-options>


==== Make a system-wide installation ====

To make a system-wide installation you will need "administrator rights";
if you do not have these rights, look at the next section about "personal installation".

These steps should work:
```
 cd <BOOST_DIR>
 ./bootstrap.sh
 sudo ./b2  variant=release  threading=multi  link=static  install
```

Remember the note for old MacBooks!

==== Personal installation ====

Anyone can make a personal installation; if you do not have "administrator right"
then you must do this.

Before compiling you must decide where to put your personal installation;
this must be somewhere inside your own filespace.  For example, I can choose
to install BOOST into ``/home/john/software``

Now I do the following steps: the ``prefix`` option says where to install BOOST
```
 cd <BOOST_DIR>
 ./bootstrap.sh  --prefix=/home/john/software
 ./b2  variant=release  threading=multi  link=static  install
```

Recall the note above about old MacBooks!


==== Making a minimal installation ====

I do not really recommend this.

If you do not want to install the complete BOOST libraries then you
can specify which ones by giving an option to ``bootstrap.sh``.
For instance CoCoA-5 needs the sub-libraries ``filesystem`` and ``system``.

The steps to follow then look like this:
```
 cd <BOOST_DIR>
 ./bootstrap.sh  --with-libraries="filesystem,system"
 ./b2  ... <options-for-b2>
```

=== Telling CoCoA-5 where BOOST is ===

If you have a system-side installation, the CoCoA ``configure`` script should
probably find it automatically.  If you made a personal installation then you
must tell CoCoA where to find it: in the example above I chose to install
BOOST into ``/home/john/software``, so I must tell CoCoA where it is:
``` 
cd CoCoALib-0.99
./configure  --with-boost-hdr-dir=/home/john/software  <more-configure-options>
make
```

While BOOST is an interesting and worthy project, we endeavour to
avoid using it inside CoCoALib.
