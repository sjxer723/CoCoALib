== INSTALLATION guide for CoCoALib ==

CoCoALib is supplied as **SOURCE** code in C++, and so must be **COMPILED**
before you can use it -- these instructions tell you how to do this on a
GNU/Linux computer (and probably Mac OS X).  See below for Microsoft Windows.


=== Prerequisites and Preparation ===

Before compilation you must ensure that you have available:-

- the GNU ``make`` program (other versions may work too);
- a C++ compiler together with the standard C++ libraries (//e.g.// ``g++``)
- an installation of GMP; more details in [[ExternalLibs-GMP]]
- if you want to build ``CoCoA-5`` too, you need the **BOOST libraries**
   (see ``http://www.boost.org/``); more details are in [[src/CoCoA-5/INSTALL]]


2022-04-11: I have just done a build on a clean Linux box.
For CoCoALib I had to install the following packages:
- ``emacs`` [optional]
- ``g++``  also if you prefer:  ``clang++`` seems to work
- ``libgmp-dev`` (but probably better to compile from source ``http://gmplib.org/``)
- ``make``
- ``texlive``
- ``texlive-latex-extra``
- ``txt2tags`` (I think I got this from another source)
- unfortunately java is needed to rebuild the documentation


For CoCoA-5 the following additional packages are needed:
- ``libboost-all-dev`` or possibly just ``libboost-filesystem-dev`` and ``libboost-system-dev``
- [optional]  ``libreadline-dev``


For the Qt GUI the following extra packages are needed:
- ``qt5make``
- ``libqt5webkit5-dev``


For developers/curious who want to use ``ExtLib-GSL``:
- ``liblapack-dev``


=== Compilation of CoCoALib ===

Extract the .tgz file and ``cd`` into the root directory ``CoCoALib-NNN``:
```
  tar xzf CoCoALib-NNN.tgz
  cd CoCoALib-NNN
```

Then configure and compile.
In most cases the following two commands will suffice:
```
  ./configure  --only-cocoalib
  make
```

The command ``make`` compiles CoCoALib (and puts it in ``lib/libcocoa.a``);
it also compiles & runs the test suite, and compiles the example programs.

``` Good news: all CoCoALib tests passed


=== Compilation of CoCoA-5 (without GUI) ===

Extract the .tgz file and ``cd`` into the root directory ``CoCoALib-NNN``:
```
  tar xzf CoCoALib-NNN.tgz
  cd CoCoALib-NNN
```

Then configure and compile.
In most cases the following two commands will suffice:
```
  ./configure  --no-qt-gui
  make
```

This compiles CoCoALib as before (incl. tests & examples).
It also compiles ``CoCoAInterpreter`` (in ``src/CoCoA-5``), and
runs all the CoCoA-5 tests.  To run CoCoA-5 it is best to use
the lauch script ``cocoa5`` (which is in ``src/CoCoA-5``).


=== Compilation of CoCoA-5 with GUI ===

Extract the .tgz file and ``cd`` into the root directory ``CoCoALib-NNN``:
```
  tar xzf CoCoALib-NNN.tgz
  cd CoCoALib-NNN
```

Then configure and compile.
In most cases the following two commands will suffice:
```
  ./configure
  make
```

After ``configure`` check to see if there was a message about being
unable to build the GUI.  If so, check that you have all the
necessary packages installed (see above).

This compiles CoCoALib and  ``CoCoAInterpreter`` & runs the tests.
Then it compiles the GUI -- be patient!  The executable for the GUI
is in ``src/CoCoA-5/C5``


== INSTALLATION ==

After compilation you can try installing CoCoALib and CoCoA-5.
Be careful: this has been little tested!

It should suffice to execute:
```  make install




==== Notes ====

(1) The configure script looks for the GMP library, and makes a few checks.
    It assumes your compiler is ``g++``.  If it encounters a problem, it will
    print out a helpful error message telling you.

(2) The command ``make library`` will compile the library but not run the tests.
    The command ``make check`` will run the tests -- they are in ``src/tests/``.
    CoCoALib does not yet have an official ``make install`` target.

(3) For the adventurous: the command
```       ./configure --help
    explains the various options the script recognizes.

(4) Optimization for small polynomials (//not really recommended//)
    By default ``CoCoALib`` allows quite polynomials of quite high degree
    (//e.g.// typically beyond 1000000).  If you are sure that degrees will
    remain small (//e.g.// below 1000) then you //might obtain better performance//
    by editing the source file ``include/CoCoA/config.H`` so that the ``typedef``
    for ``SmallExponent_t`` is ``unsigned short`` instead of ``unsigned int``.
    But **beware** that CoCoALib does not generally check for exponent overflow
    during polynomial arithmetic!


=== Documentation & Examples ===

Main documentation for CoCoALib: ``CoCoALib-XX/doc/html`` and ``CoCoALib-XX/CoCoALib.pdf``

Example programs using CoCoALib: ``CoCoALib-XX/examples/index.html``



=== Troubleshooting (and known issues) ===

If you encounter problems while compiling or using CoCoALib,
the best way to let us know is to report the issue via
```    http://cocoa.dima.unige.it/redmine/

Please tell us also the platform and compiler you are using.

Alternatively you can send us email at ``cocoa@dima.unige.it``

==== Known Issues ====

Recent MacOSX systems use the "llvm" compiler which produces
numerous warnings with the BOOST libraries; please ignore these
warnings.  If you know how to edit makefiles, you can add the
flag ``-Wno-c99-extensions`` to the definition of ``CXXFLAGS_CUSTOM``
on line 3 of ``src/CoCoA-5/Makefile`` -- this should get rid of
most of the warnings.


%----------------------------------------------------------------------
== Installing CoCoA on Microsoft Windows ==

You can build ``CoCoALib`` and ``CoCoA-5`` on a //Microsoft Windows//
computer by using ``Cygwin``, a free package which provides a
Linux-like environment (see ``http://www.cygwin.com/``).

Once you have installed ``Cygwin``, start its terminal emulator,
and then follow the usual instructions above for compiling ``CoCoALib``.


=== Installing Cygwin ===

**IMPORTANT:** installing Cygwin can take quite some time.

Download the script ``setup.exe`` from the Cygwin website
(``http://www.cygwin.com/``)
Start the script and choose //install from internet//;
if necessary, choose //direct connection// to internet.
You will be asked which mirror site to download from;
pick a nearby one (//e.g.// in your country).
Using that script select the following extension packages:
- gcc-g++
- make
- m4
- libboost-devel
- libboost-1.48
- libgmp-devel
- emacs
-


Once you have ``Cygwin`` working, you can build CoCoA.  Download the
CoCoA sources, and put the downloaded CoCoA file in your cygwin
filespace (//e.g.// in your cygwin home which is the folder
``c:\cygwin\home\``//userid//) so it can be accessed from a cygwin
"terminal".  Now follow the instructions above.


==== CoCoA-5 GUI ====

This is a bit complicated (we don't really recommend it).

If you want to build the ``CoCoA-5`` GUI, you must obtain also
these extension packages for Cygwin
- qt4-devel-tools
- libqtcore4 
- libqtcore4devel
- libqtgui4
- libqtgui4-devel
- libqtxml4-devel
- xorg-server
- xinit
- emacs-X11    (not necessary, but probably helpful)
-

Inside Cygwin copy the file ``/lib/qt4/bin/qmake.exe`` into the
directory ``/usr/local/bin/``.


=== In Case of Trouble ===

We cannot really help you, as we have almost no experience ourselves
of Microsoft computers.  Switch to Linux, or try searching on the internet...


The following instructions may help if you cannot start the GUI.
If the Xserver does not start properly, create (from MS Windows)
a ``.bat`` file in the folder ``c:\cygwin`` containing the following
```
@echo off

cd bin

@rem dash -l -i -c "echo ' !!  Starting rebasing. Be patient  !! \n' ; rebaseall -s 'dll|so|oct' -T /usr/local/lista_rebase"
dash -l -i -c "echo ' !!  Starting rebasing. Be patient  !! \n' ; rebaseall -s 'dll|so|oct' "


echo .
echo  !!  No rebaseall errors ?  Then everything is fine,   !!  
echo  !!  otherwise you have other cygwin processes running !!
echo .

pause
```

and run it (from MS Windows).


Set up the configuration of the xserver to create a CoCoA-5 shortcut:
in a cygwin terminal, create a file called ``.XWinrc`` containing the
following:
```
SilentExit
Menu apps {
	C5 EXEC "CoCoALib-xxxx/src/CoCoA-5/C5.exe  --packageDir CoCoALib-xxxx/src/CoCoA-5/packages"
	xterm	exec	"xterm"
	"Emacs"	exec	"emacs"
	notepad	exec	notepad
	SEPARATOR
	"Reload .XWinrc"	RELOAD
}
RootMenu apps
```


To have the CoCoA-5 GUI start automatically when you start ``Cygwin``, place
the following line in a file called ``.startxwinrc`` in your cygwin home directory.
```
/home/<USERID>/CoCoALib/src/CoCoA-5/C5.exe  --packageDir CoCoALib/src/CoCoA-5/packages
```
